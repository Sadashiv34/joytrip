        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <div class="terms-text">
Welcome to JoyTrip, your instant tourist place discovery assistant. These Terms and Conditions explain how you can use our service, and how we protect both your rights and ours. The app is currently in a prototype/MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage, and we're improving it constantly.

By using JoyTrip, you agree to these terms. If you're not comfortable with early-stage functionality or potential bugs, we understand â€” you may wait until the full version is released.

1. About JoyTrip (MVP)

JoyTrip is currently in testing and development. The goal is to provide a platform that helps you discover nearby tourist places using location-based services. While core functionality is active, features are limited and still being improved.

Some information may be incomplete, outdated, or not fully optimized. You're using the app as a test user, and your feedback is welcome.

2. User Responsibilities

When using JoyTrip, you agree to:

Use the platform responsibly and legally.

Avoid attempts to misuse, copy, or disrupt the system.

Understand that this is a work-in-progress, and some errors or inconsistencies may exist.

This is not a final release, and things will break. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.

3. Use of Location Data & Privacy

JoyTrip uses your device's location to suggest nearby tourist spots. Location access is temporary and voluntary â€” only used to generate results.

We don't collect or store personal data. No tracking. No selling. We take your privacy seriously, even at this early stage. Please see our Privacy Policy for more.

4. Content and Tools Ownership

JoyTrip's core structure â€” including its design, logic, user flow, and branding â€” is original and owned by us.

We use third-party services for essential functionality:

Firebase (Google) â€“ for database, authentication

Geoapify â€“ for maps, location and more 

We do not own or control these services but use them under their public terms. All original code and content built around them is our intellectual property. Please do not copy or redistribute without permission.

5. Third-Party Services (Geoapify & Firebase)

This MVP depends on external APIs, and we're still learning how best to integrate them.
We're not liable for:

Errors or outages from Firebase, Geoapify, or any third-party system

Inaccurate or incomplete tourist data

Temporary issues with map loading or location detection

We're working on it â€” and your bug reports help.

6. No Guarantees

JoyTrip MVP is provided "as-is". That means:

It may be incomplete

Some features may not work as expected

Data accuracy may vary

Service interruptions may occur

We do not accept liability for any decisions or actions based on the current app output.

7. Termination of Use

We may block or restrict access to anyone who:

Misuses the app

Interferes with testing

Attempts to harm, copy, or clone the system

This app is being shared for honest usage and testing only.

8. Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of India. All legal matters will be resolved in courts located in [Bangalore Karnataka].

9. Contact

We're open to your questions, ideas, and bug reports.
